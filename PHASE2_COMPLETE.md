## 🔧 How to Use the New Landing Page

### Option 1: Replace Existing Landing Page

Update your router to use `ModernLandingPage`:

```tsx
// src/App.tsx or your router file
import ModernLandingPage from '@/components/ModernLandingPage';

// Replace
<Route path="/" element={<LandingPage />} />

// With
<Route path="/" element={<ModernLandingPage />} />
```

### Option 2: A/B Testing

Keep both and test performance:

```tsx
// Switch based on feature flag
const useModern = true; // or from config

<Route
    path="/"
    element={useModern ? <ModernLandingPage /> : <LandingPage />}
/>;
```

### Option 3: Gradual Rollout

Use individual sections in the existing page:

```tsx
import { HeroSection } from "@/components/landing/HeroSection";

// Replace old hero with new one
<HeroSection onViewCourses={scrollToCourses} />;
```
