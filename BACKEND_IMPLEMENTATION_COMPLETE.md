- Configured file upload support (`python-multipart`)
- Set up static file serving for transaction screenshots (`/uploads`)
- All middleware working (CORS, security headers, rate limiting)

### ✅ **6. File Upload System**

---

## 🔑 Key Features Implemented

### **1. Admin Payment Account Management**

Admin can configure payment accounts:

- Multiple payment types (CBE, TeleBirr, Commercial Bank, etc.)

### **2. User Payment Flow**

1. User clicks "Enroll" on course
2. Sees list of active admin payment accounts
3. Pays to one account
4. Uploads transaction screenshot
5. Submits payment request
6. Waits for admin approval

### **3. Admin Approval Flow**

1. Admin sees pending payment requests
2. Views transaction screenshot
3. Approves or rejects
4. **Upon approval**:
   - Payment marked as approved
   - User enrolled in course
   - If user was referred, referrer gets 10% bonus
   - All happens atomically

### **4. Referral System**

- Automatic detection of referrals
- 10% bonus of course price
- Bonus credited to referrer's `total_earnings`
- Tracked in `referral_earnings` table
- Status: pending → paid

### **5. My Courses**

- Users see all enrolled courses
- Progress tracking (0-100%)
- Completion tracking
- Course details included

## 🔜 Next Steps

1. **Test Backend Endpoints** using Swagger UI or Postman
2. **Build Admin Payment UI** for managing payment accounts
3. **Build User Payment UI** for enrollment and payment submission
4. **Test End-to-End Flow**:
   - Admin creates payment account
   - User enrolls and pays
   - Admin approves
   - User sees course in "My Courses"
   - Referrer gets bonus (if applicable)

---

## 💡 Key Implementation Details

### **Referral Bonus Calculation**:

```python
referral_bonus_percentage = 10  # 10% of course price
referral_amount = (course_price * referral_bonus_percentage) / 100
```

### **Atomic Transactions**:

The `approve_payment_and_enroll` function uses database transactions to ensure:

- Either all operations succeed, or none do
- No partial updates
- Data consistency

### **UUID Handling**:

All UUIDs are automatically converted to strings in database operations for
frontend compatibility.

### **camelCase Conversion**:

All snake_case database fields are converted to camelCase for
JavaScript/TypeScript compatibility.
