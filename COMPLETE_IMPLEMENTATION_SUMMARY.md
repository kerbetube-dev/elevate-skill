## 🎯 **What We Built**

### **Complete Payment & Enrollment System**

A full-featured payment and enrollment system where:

1. Admin configures payment accounts (CBE, TeleBirr, etc.)
2. Users enroll in courses and pay via admin's accounts
3. Users upload transaction screenshots
4. Admin reviews and approves/rejects payments
5. Approved payments automatically enroll users
6. Referral bonuses are automatically distributed

---

## ✅ **Backend Implementation (100%)**

### **1. Database Schema**

- ✅ `admin_payment_accounts` - Admin's bank accounts
- ✅ `payment_requests` - User payment submissions

- ✅ `referral_earnings` - Referral bonus tracking

### **2. API Endpoints (10 new endpoints)**

#### Payment Accounts API:

- `GET /payment-accounts/` - List payment accounts

## 🚀 **How It Works**

### **User Flow:**

1. User browses courses on landing page
2. Clicks "Enroll Now" on desired course
3. If not logged in → Redirected to login
4. If logged in → Redirected to payment page
5. Selects payment method (CBE, TeleBirr, etc.)
6. Makes payment to admin's account
7. Uploads transaction screenshot
8. Submits payment request
9. Waits for admin approval
10. Upon approval → Course appears in "My Courses"
11. If referred → Referrer gets 10% bonus

### **Admin Flow:**

1. Admin logs into admin panel
2. Configures payment accounts in "Payment Accounts" tab
3. Monitors payment requests in "Payment Requests" tab
4. Reviews transaction screenshots
5. Approves or rejects payments
6. System automatically enrolls user upon approval
