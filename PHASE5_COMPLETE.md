## 🚀 How to Use

### Activate Course Details

The course details page is already integrated into `ModernCourseDetails.tsx`. To
use it:

```tsx
// In your router (already set up)
<Route path="/course/:courseId" element={<UserCourseDetail />} />;

// UserCourseDetail.tsx should use ModernCourseDetails
import { ModernCourseDetails } from "@/components/course/ModernCourseDetails";

export default function UserCourseDetail() {
    return <ModernCourseDetails />;
}
```

### Activate Modern Payment Page

Update your PaymentPage component:

```tsx
// src/pages/PaymentPage.tsx
import { ModernPaymentPage } from "@/components/payment/ModernPaymentPage";

export default function PaymentPage() {
    return <ModernPaymentPage />;
}
```
